**Security Testing:
Optionally, tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP can be used to test for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or insecure session handling.
I also encourage you to use ChatGPT or similar AI tools to help you find vulnerabilities in the code as I do not expect you to be an expert in web application development.
 

**Additional Tips for Students
Document Everything:
As you find vulnerabilities or issues, document them thoroughly in your SDR report. Include screenshots, descriptions of the issue, and any proposed fixes.
 

**Study the Codebase:
Review the application's architecture and key components. Understand how different parts of the application interact and where security-critical components (e.g., authentication, search, data storage, etc.) are located.

-Study: Analyze the documentation and code to identify the overall design and functionality.
-Inquire: Ask questions about the code, either within the group or by researching online, to clarify how certain security aspects are implemented.
-Identify: Focus on the most security-critical areas, such as input validation, access controls, data storage, and API usage.
-Collaborate: Discuss potential security issues with peers or instructors and propose mitigations.
-Write: Document the findings, including specific code examples where security issues were identified, and suggest code improvements.
-Follow Up: Reflect on how the proposed changes would improve the security of the application.
**Submit Report:

Provide a detailed report with code snippets, analysis, and recommendations. Be prepared to discuss your findings with the class such as discussing how security was evaluated and what improvements could be made.
